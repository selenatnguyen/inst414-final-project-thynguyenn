#The project I am working on focuses on rent prices in orange county. Rent cost in Orange county is very high and it changes depending on the neighborhood. This makes it hard for people to know how much they should expect to pay. My project tries to fix this by using data to predict how much rent will cost in different areas. If we can predict the rent, renters can plan their budgets better and landlords can set reasonable prices.
I am using two main dataset. One if from the department of numbers and the other is from the American Community Survey.
